### Part 2 (75 pts)

Security is one the most important aspects of a business. Security breaches, attacks, and exploitation can cause irredeemable damage. If I found out that division I work for has several security-related problems I would immediately report it to my project manager or boss. If the company is unwilling to postpone the ECU’s release, I would try to convince and negotiate. I would explain to them that it’s important to plan for the worst and that bypassing security would only upsurge the chances of ruining the company’s reputation if anything went wrong.
If the company doesn’t budge, my last resort would be to let the public know. As much as I believe that this would amplify the chances of an exploitation, it would also make customers aware. For example, Drupal announces all security vulnerabilities associated with Drupal core, modules and plugins. While this makes the users of the content management system mindful, it opens a gateway for hackers. During my summer internship, I had to identify how the company’s website got hacked. On researching, I found out that Drupal’s highly critical remote code execution vulnerability (nicknamed Drupalgeddon 2.0) had been exploited. The chances the attack would’ve been decreased by at least 80% if Drupal’s security team did not disclose it publicly. Instead, Drupal could’ve released an updated version with a patch. Similarly, the automotive manufacturer should do that same. Fix the ECU and announce the patches made later. 
If all in vain, I would warn people personally through family, friends, and coworkers. After all my attempts, I would not consider myself responsible for any harm that results.
