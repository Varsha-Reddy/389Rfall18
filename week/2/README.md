Yes, I found a hidden directory. I navigated to http://cornerstoneairlines.co/robots.txt 
This gave me a hint to the name of the directory by displaying:
User-agent: *
Disallow: /secret
Yes, I did find a flag by looking at the page source for http://cornerstoneairlines.co/secret/: CMSC389R-{fly_th3_sk1es_w1th_u5}

5. Did you find any other IP addresses associated with this website? What do they link to, or where did you find them?
Yes, 142.93.118.186. I found it through reverse IP Domain Check via you get signal. It links to cornerstoneairlines.co

6. If you found any associated server(s), where are they located? How did you discover this?
According to whois.com, 
Address:        101 Ave of the Americas

I put in a random directory to see if the "Not Found" page would display any information. 

8. **BONUS:** Did you find any other flags on your OSINT mission? (Up to 9 pts!)

<!-- Keep looking, class! You're very close :) -->
Found the flag by viewing page source of admin directory. 
<!-- CMSC389R-{h1dden_fl4g_in_s0urce} -->


### Part 2

Use the provided python stub code [('stub.py')](stub.py) or write your own program in another language to gain access to the Cornerstone Airlines administrator server via an open port that you should have found in Part 1. 

Once you have gained access to the Cornerstone Airlines administrator portal with the correct login credentials, you will have access to a system shell. 

Use your knowledge of Linux and OSINT techniques to locate a specific flight record, read it, and submit the flag inside.

Your response here should briefly document how you approached and solved this part of the assignment. You should also push your bruteforce program to the "week/2/writeup" folder of your GitHub repository.

Note: If you choose to write your own program in another language, please include instructions on how to execute your program, including what version of the language you are using. You will **NOT** receive credit if the TAs cannot run your program.

If you are stuck on this part of the assignment, let us know! The facilitator staff is here to help and teach, and we are open to releasing hints as time goes on!
ANSWER: 
The username is Kruegster and password is pokemon. 
I gained access to the administrator portal by using the command: nc 142.93.117.193 1337
I found the port number through nmap. 
After logging in, I navigated to /home/flight_records
Through Kruegster's instagram posts, I found pictures of a boarding pass with the number AAC27670. 
The file AAC27670.txt had CMSC389R-{c0rn3rstone-air27670}

### Format
In the "week/2/writeup" directory of our repository there is a README.md file for you to edit and submit your homework in. Use this as a template and directly edit it with your answers. Complete your bruteforce program in this directory as well. When you've finished the assignment, [Push it](https://github.com/UMD-CS-STICs/389Rfall18/blob/master/HW_Submit_Instructions.md) up to your personal GitHub for us to grade.

Your responses to every prompt in this assignment should include answers to any specific questions along with a brief explanation of your thought process and how you obtained the answer.
