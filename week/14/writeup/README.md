## Assignment 10 Writeup

### Part 1 (70 Pts)
Looking at "Such a quick, little" from the project description, it was clear that SQL injection had to be performed. After analysing the links on the website in the "item table" I noticied that item?id=number changed each item, where number 0,1,or 2. With the help of the example in Week 11 Web slides which used *admin' OR '1'='1'-- -*, I used *'0 or true -- "*. This displayed all the items as well as a
flag.

### Part 2 (30 Pts)
**LEVEL 1**: For this level, the mission was to inject a script to pop up a JavaScript alert() in the frame. I used simple JavaScript, quoted string in a script block. I entered the following query in the search box, *<script>alert("Level 1")</script>*. It prompted me to the next level.

**LEVEL 2**: For this level, I used one of the hints which said that the template does not escape the contents of the status message. On researching a little bit about this, I figured out I had to use an image tag. This was a form of stored XSS attack. I injected the following script in the comment/status box, *<img src=x onerror=alert('Level2')>* and it worked.

**LEVEL 3**: For this level, I had to edit the address in the URL bar. With the help of a hint that suggested that data in the window.location object can be influenced by an attacker, I tried to analyze the target code. I noticed that window.location.hash was set 
'num' which was appended to img src. After several failed attempts, I realised something was wrong with the URL in the game. I switched browsers from Chrome to Explorer. I tried escaping the URL with *'onerror="alert('Level3');"*, and it worked. (No idea why the exact same thing did not work on Chrome)

**LEVEL 4**: I first clicked on create timer, I noticed that this changes the URL and counts down to the numbers of seconds in the box. This problem looked similar to the one on the previous level. Intially, I tried to use onload=alert("trial")>. When I created the timer, the timer did not stop. The third hint suggested to try entering a single quote (') and watch the error console. When I looked at the error console, I got a better understanding of how the input injection was taking place. I tried inputting *);alert('level4* in the timer box, and it worked.

**LEVEL 5**: For this level, I first clicked on "Sign up". I noticed the URL had next=confirm. I looked at the target code of the sign up frame. This gave me some information about how the URL parameter is used. After trying to append tags, I tried to use the third hint which indicated that "javascript" was to be used. I did a little reading on "If you want to make clicking a link execute Javascript (without using the onclick handler), how can you do it?". One useful link was: *https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1265887/call-javascript-function-on-hyperlink-click*. I tried to use *next=javascript:alert("level5")* and I was prompted to the next level.
